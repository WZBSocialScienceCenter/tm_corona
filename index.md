This is a small project to showcase topic modeling with the [tmtoolkit Python package](https://tmtoolkit.readthedocs.io/), where I use a corpus of articles from the German online news website *[Spiegel Online (SPON)](https://www.spiegel.de/)*  to create a topic model for before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This topic model is then used to analyze the volume of media coverage regarding the pandemic and how it changed over time. Currently, a time span from Oct. 2019 to end of Aug. 2020 is covered but I plan to give an update for a time span until end of Nov. 2020.

**The main analysis is done in a [Jupyter notebook](https://wzbsocialsciencecenter.github.io/tm_corona/tm_analysis.html). Head over there for an application of topic models.** For the other scripts, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WZBSocialScienceCenter/tm_corona/).
